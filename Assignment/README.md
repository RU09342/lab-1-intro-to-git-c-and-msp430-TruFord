# Lab Exercise 1: Introduction to C & Git
This lab was meant to introduce one to to creating a .c program, properly documenting code,
and proper commiting to git-hub.

#  Usage

After including the math.h and math.c files in the same working directory as your project, you need to simple call the following function to perform the require operation: Math(int1, int2, operator);

## Valid Inputs

### int1, int2

16-bit signed integers

### Operator

char which is valid for the following values ['+', '-', '*', '/', '%']. Math() will return Null if this input it invalid.

# Functions

## Add (char = '+')

int1 will be added to int2 and function will return the sum as a signed integer.

Example (10 + 20)

Math( 10, 20, '+');

## Subtract (char = '-')

int 2 will be subtracted from int 1 and function will return the difference as a signed integer.

Example (10 - 20)

Math( 10, 20, '-');

## Multiply (char = '*')

int 1 will be multiplied by int2 and function will return the difference as a signed integer.

Example (10 * 20)

Math( 10, 20, '*');

## Divide (char = '/')

int1 will be integer divided by int2. This will only return the quotient as an integer.
