# Lab Exercise 1: Introduction to C & Git
This lab was meant to introduce one to to creating a .c program, properly documenting code,
and proper commiting to git-hub.

#  Usage

After including the math.h and math.c files in the same working directory as your project, you need to simple call the following function to perform the require operation: Math(int1, int2, operator);

## Valid Inputs

```
 int1, int2

      signed integers

 Operator

      char which is valid for the following values: '+', '-', '*', '/', '%'.
```

# Functions

```
 Add (char = '+')

    int1 will be added to int2 and function will return the sum as a signed integer.

 Subtract (char = '-')

    int2 will be subtracted from int1 and function will return the difference as a signed integer.

 Multiply (char = '*')

    int1 will be multiplied by int2 and function will return the difference as a signed integer.

 Divide (char = '/')

    int1 will be integer divided by int2. This will only return the quotient as an integer.
